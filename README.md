# seo-challenge

## Description

Horiseon needed thier webpage to meet accessibility standards. In fixing these issues, title element needed to be addressed, heading attributes needed a logical order and structure of html elements needed to have more semantics to them. Lastly all the code overall needed to follow a more logiacal structure. 

Making these changes helped me whats called "code refactor" As this what is reffered to when you improve code but don't change what is does. 


## Installation

Steps taking to fix issues were as follows:
Change title element
Change heading attributes that needed to be changed
Add alt images to images and change color of seo in Horiseon to a darker shade for better contrast
Change some of the html elements so when looking at them you find semantic html elements
Change structure of html and css code to find a more logical structure
